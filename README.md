Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.


Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in financial systems. This project employs logistic regression, a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes the following features:

Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1 to V28: Result of a PCA transformation.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: Target variable (1 indicates fraud, 0 indicates non-fraud).
